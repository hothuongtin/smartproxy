# Documentation Update Summary

## Changes Made to Reflect Recent SmartProxy Improvements

### Core Changes Documented:
1. **MITM Authentication**: MITM mode now requires authentication for all requests
2. **Static File Detection**: Works with HTTPS when MITM is enabled
3. **Upstream Routing**: Both HTTP and HTTPS properly route through configured upstream proxy

### Files Updated:

#### Main Documentation:
- **README.md**
  - Added note about MITM requiring authentication
  - Updated HTTPS support feature description
  - Added note about static file detection working with MITM

- **README_vi.md** (Vietnamese)
  - Same updates as README.md but in Vietnamese
  - Added authentication requirement note for MITM mode

- **CLAUDE.md**
  - Added important notes about MITM authentication requirement
  - Noted static file detection works seamlessly with MITM
  - Updated numbering for consistency

#### HTTPS Documentation:
- **docs/en/HTTPS_SETUP.md**
  - Added authentication requirement to MITM mode description
  - Added new section "Authentication in MITM Mode"
  - Updated use cases for MITM mode to include static file detection

- **docs/vi/HTTPS_SETUP_vi.md** (Vietnamese)
  - Same updates as HTTPS_SETUP.md but in Vietnamese
  - Added authentication section explaining security benefits

#### Debug Documentation:
- **docs/en/DEBUG_LOGGING.md**
  - Added example of static file detection with HTTPS
  - New section "HTTPS with MITM" showing debug logs
  - Shows authentication check and routing decisions

- **docs/vi/DEBUG_LOGGING_vi.md** (Vietnamese)
  - Same updates as DEBUG_LOGGING.md but in Vietnamese
  - Added HTTPS MITM debug examples

#### Technical Documentation:
- **STATIC_FILE_DEBUG_EXPLANATION.md**
  - Completely rewritten to reflect that the issue is now fixed
  - Changed from explaining limitations to showcasing the solution
  - Added examples of working MITM authentication
  - Highlighted key improvements

### Key Messages in Updated Documentation:
1. **Security**: MITM mode requires authentication, preventing unauthorized interception
2. **Functionality**: Static file detection and intelligent routing work perfectly with MITM enabled
3. **Transparency**: Debug logs show complete routing decisions for HTTPS when MITM is active
4. **Usage**: Clear examples showing how to use authentication with MITM mode

### Consistent Theme:
All documentation now emphasizes that the recent changes have made SmartProxy more secure (requiring authentication for MITM) while maintaining full functionality (static file detection, intelligent routing) for HTTPS traffic when MITM is enabled.
