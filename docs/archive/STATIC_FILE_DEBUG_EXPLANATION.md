# Static File Detection Debug Logging

## Static File Detection with HTTPS - Now Fixed!

Previously, when requesting `https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/images/3on.svg?a=1`, SmartProxy couldn't detect this was a `.svg` file. This has been fixed:

### 1. HTTPS without MITM (default)
- Proxy only receives CONNECT request: `CONNECT kdp.amazon.com:443`
- Cannot see the actual path (`/en_US/images/3on.svg`)
- Only knows domain and port, not file type

### 2. HTTPS with MITM enabled (NEW - NOW WORKING!)
- **Authentication Required**: MITM mode now requires proxy authentication for security
- **Static File Detection**: Works perfectly with HTTPS when MITM is enabled
- **Intelligent Routing**: Properly routes static files directly, others through upstream
- **Full Debug Logs**: You'll see complete routing decisions for HTTPS requests

### 3. Example logs with MITM enabled:
```
DEBUG MITM authentication check passed upstream=http://proxy.com:8080
DEBUG Intercepting HTTPS request method=GET url=https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/images/3on.svg
DEBUG URL identified as static file extension=.svg action=direct_connection
DEBUG Using direct connection for HTTPS static file
```

## How to test static file detection:

### Option 1: Use HTTP URLs
```bash
curl -x "$PROXY" "http://example.com/image.jpg"
curl -x "$PROXY" "http://example.com/style.css"
```

### Option 2: Enable HTTPS MITM (RECOMMENDED)
In `configs/config.yaml`:
```yaml
server:
  https_mitm: true
  ca_cert: "certs/ca.crt"
  ca_key: "certs/ca.key"
```

Then:
```bash
make ca-cert  # Generate CA certificate
make restart  # Restart proxy
# Install CA cert on your system
# Test with authentication:
curl -x "http://http:$(echo -n 'proxy.com:8080' | base64)@localhost:8888" "https://example.com/script.js"
```

## Key Improvements
1. **MITM Authentication**: All MITM requests now require proper authentication
2. **Static File Detection**: Works seamlessly with HTTPS when MITM is enabled
3. **Upstream Routing**: HTTPS requests properly route through configured upstream proxy
4. **Debug Visibility**: Full routing decisions visible in debug logs for HTTPS
